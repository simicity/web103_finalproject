## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to create the ERD and wireframe with the help of the resoureces on the course page. As we create the wireframe and the ERD, the system design is becoming clearer and specific. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We needed to refine the system design/functionalities to draw the ERD and wireframe, but it helped us have a clearer understanding of our project goals.

It was a bit challenging to think over the system details and to strike a balance between a more practical design and a less complex implementation.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Nothing in particular.
